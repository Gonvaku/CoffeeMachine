# Coffee Machine
Simple OOP proyect for JetBrains:

- This program mimics the behaviour of a real coffee machine without role profiling, it's a demostration of how OOP programming works by "Divide-and-conquer".
- You can ask the machine for a particular cup of coffee, each one having their own requisites.
- The machine won't make a cup of coffee if it doesn't have the materials to do it, authorized personnel should refill them if needed.
